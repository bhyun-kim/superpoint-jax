# SuperPoint Inference with JAX/Flax

This repository provides an inference-only pipeline for keypoint detection using the SuperPoint model. It includes a PyTorch implementation of SuperPoint, a JAX/Flax (NNX) implementation, and a conversion script to transfer pretrained weights from PyTorch to JAX. Inference can then be performed on input images using the converted JAX model.

## Overview

- **PyTorch Model:** `superpoint_torch.py` implements the SuperPoint model in PyTorch.
- **JAX Model:** `superpoint_jax.py` contains the corresponding SuperPoint model implementation in JAX/Flax NNX.
- **Weight Conversion:** `convert_to_jax.py` includes helper functions to copy convolution and batch normalization parameters from the PyTorch model to the JAX model.
- **Demo:** A Jupyter Notebook (`demo/compare_jax_torch.ipynb`) demonstrates the entire processâ€”from converting weights to running inference and visualizing keypoints.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) and [jaxlib](https://github.com/google/jax)
- [Flax](https://flax.readthedocs.io/)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV (cv2)

## Usage

1. **Obtain Pretrained Weights:**  
   Place the pretrained PyTorch SuperPoint weights (e.g., `superpoint_torch_weights.pth`) in the repository root or a designated folder.

2. **Convert Weights:**  
   Run the conversion script to create a JAX model with copied weights and save the converted state:
   ```bash
   python convert_superpoint_model.py
